# Fall-Data-Challenge-2020

### Aims:
# provide insights to inspire more people to vote
# in the upcoming November 3rd election


### Information Provided:
# age, gender, race, ethnicity, marital status, military veteran status,
# size of community, employment status, and educational background. 
# whether they were registered to vote (and if they were not registered, the reason why not),
# whether they voted in the most recent election (and if they didn’t vote, the reason why not),
# whether they voted on Election day or before, in person or by mail.

# Because the data on respondents’ educational backgrounds go into some detail
# (including their current college enrollment status and number of years of
# college credit obtained), the dataset might be of particular interest for high
# school and college students interested in exploring voter turnout in young people
# ahead of this historic 2020 election.
